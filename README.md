What if we'd use `class A extends B` as a way to compose classes, instead of just using prototypal inheritance?

This experiment shows how to use classes for scenarios like this:
- I need a ***Dog***!
- it's an ***Animal***, so it can ***Breathe***.
- an ***Animal*** is an ***Entity***, so it can ***Eat*** and ***Poop***
- this ***Dog*** can also ***Bark***
- and some types of ***Dogs*** can ***Hunt***.
